# Predicting Vehicle Prices Using Regression Models
Exploratory Data Analysis On New York City Yellow Taxi Data


## **Objectives**  
The primary goal of this exercise is to develop a robust regression model to predict used car prices for a reseller based on various listed features and specifications. In addition to predicting prices, the exercise focuses on identifying feature importance and mitigating overfitting through the application of regularisation techniques.

There can be several business objectives for this, such as:

* **Price Prediction**: Model car prices based on features like mileage, fuel type, and performance.
* **Market Analysis**: Explore trends and preferences in the used car market, by type, region, or other metrics.
* **Feature Importance**: Identify the most important factors influencing car prices (e.g., fuel type, mileage, age).
